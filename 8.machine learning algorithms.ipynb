    "Machine learning algorithms are techniques used to build models that can learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed for the task. These algorithms can be broadly categorized into three types: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Below are some common machine learning algorithms within each category:\n",
